> Dharma Reader

With this software you will be able to read original Chinese Buddhist texts

Dharma Reader was created for people who want to read Buddhist texts not only in translation, but also in the original and to expand existing basic language skills quickly and efficiently, especially what concerns the acquisition of specialist terminology. But even beginners can  venture to enter into the fascinating world of East Asian Buddhism using an introductory course into Buddhist Chinese that will soon be available also in German.

Dharma Reader is an open source software project that is being developed in a Russian-German-Chinese-American cooperation and is based on the linguistic analysis system Morpheus developed by Russian programmer Michael Bykov.

In a longer perspective, the aim of Dharma Reader is offering reading support for all languages ​​in which texts of the Buddhist canon or other important Buddhist texts were written.

As a first stage of development, we have released a Chinese reading interface that allows software-supported reading of texts from the Taishô codex or other Buddhist texts. This is done by lightning-fast lookups of terminology contained in the displayed text in modern and extensive dictionaries for Buddhist terminology which were created by specialists. In addition, the reading of parallel texts is possible (i.e., already translated texts in a synopsis of original and target language), but also the reading of other sources such as modern Chinese newspaper texts. The software supports both traditional Chinese characters and simplified script as used in mainland China today. Chinese dictionaries are currently available bundled with target languages ​​English, German, French, Russian and Hungarian.

In future development stages, Dharma Reader will also support Pali, Sanskrit, Tibetan and other Dharma languages.

The developers of Dharma Reader deliberately turn to an interested professional audience at this early stage, because we seek contacts with people who want to test our software and contribute their criticism and comments for the sake of its further development. Of course, we also want to know what special interests our users are pursuing as this will enable us to set priorities for future developments.
