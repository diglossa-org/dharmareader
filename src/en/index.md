DharmaReader has been developed for people who want to read Buddhist texts not only in translation, but also in the original. What's more, DharmaReader intends to help users to expand their existing basic language skills quickly and efficiently, especially when it comes to the acquisition of Buddhist special terminology. But even beginners can venture to enter into the fascinating world of East Asian Buddhism using an introductory course into Buddhist Chinese by Professor John Kieschnick (Department of Religious Studies, Stanford University) whose vocabulary has been adapted for DharmaReader and will soon be available also in other languages such as German and Russian.

DharmaReader is an open source software project carried out in an international (Russian+German+American+East Asian) cooperation and based on the Morpheus engine, a linguistic analysis system developed by Russian programmer Michael Bykov.

In the long perspective, DharmaReader plans to offer reading support for all languages ​​in which texts of the Buddhist canon or other important Buddhist texts have been written such as Pali, Sanskrit, Tibetan and Tangut.

As a first stage of development, we have released a Chinese reading platform that allows software-supported reading of texts from the Taisho codex or other Buddhist texts. This is done by lightning-fast lookups of words (= segments of the selected text) in dictionaries for Buddhist and general terminology that have been created by specialists and continue to be expanded by users worldwide. Chinese dictionaries are currently available for the following target languages: ​​English, German, French, Russian and Hungarian. Both traditional and simplified Chinese characters are supported.

The developers of DharmaReader turn to an interested professional audience already at this early stage because we want to establish contacts with people who volunteer to test our software and contribute with their comments and criticism to its further development. Of course, we also want to know what special interests our users are pursuing as this will enable us to set priorities for future developments.
